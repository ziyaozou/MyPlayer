#MyPlayer
This is a programe i pull from [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer).
And I change the UI of the ExoPlayer by using some opensource library. like [Material Design Library](https://github.com/navasmdc/MaterialDesignLibrary),
[material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).
